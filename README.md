# 🌶️ SpiceCode CLI - Making your code spicier 🔥🥵

----------
i will write a better tutorial later but for now basically just:
- clone the repo yeah no shit
- create a python virtual enviroment with venv
- install the requirements.txt with ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (not sure about this one but probably works)
- install the package locally with ```pip install -e . ```
- then run it using ```spice analyze``` followed by the file to be analyzed
- example: ```spice analyze example.js```
- you can also run ```spice hello``` for a hello idk
