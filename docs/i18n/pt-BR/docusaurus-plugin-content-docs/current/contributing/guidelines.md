# Contributing to SpiceCode

We appreciate your interest in contributing to SpiceCode! Like the Fremen who value collaboration for the survival and prosperity of their sietch, community involvement is vital for the long-term health and evolution of open-source projects.

## Current Project Status: College Assignment

At this time, SpiceCode is actively being developed as part of a college assignment. Due to the specific requirements and evaluation criteria associated with this academic context, **we are currently unable to accept external contributions** in the form of code pull requests, feature additions, or significant refactoring.

This temporary restriction allows the core development team to focus on meeting the project's academic objectives and ensures that the work submitted for evaluation accurately reflects the efforts of the students involved. We understand this might be disappointing for those eager to contribute immediately, and we value your understanding and patience.

## Future Plans: Open Sourcing Contributions

Our vision for SpiceCode extends beyond the current academic requirements. We are passionate about the potential of this tool and **fully intend to open the project to community contributions in the future**, likely after the completion of the assignment phase.

Once we transition to a fully open contribution model, we plan to adopt standard open-source practices, including:

*   **Issue Tracking:** Utilizing GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions.
*   **Pull Requests:** Following the standard fork-and-pull-request workflow for code contributions.
*   **Code Style Guidelines:** Establishing clear coding standards to ensure consistency.
*   **Testing Requirements:** Defining expectations for unit and integration tests accompanying new code.
*   **Code of Conduct:** Maintaining a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors (referencing the existing `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).

We are excited about the prospect of building a vibrant community around SpiceCode and leveraging collective expertise to enhance its capabilities.

## How You Can Help Now

Even though direct code contributions are currently paused, you can still engage with the project in valuable ways:

*   **Use SpiceCode:** Install the tool and use it on your own projects. Real-world usage is the best way to uncover potential issues or areas for improvement.
*   **Report Bugs:** If you encounter any problems or unexpected behavior, please report them by creating an issue on the [SpiceCode GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/spicecodecli/spicecode/issues). Detailed bug reports are incredibly helpful.
*   **Suggest Features:** Do you have ideas for new analysis metrics, supported languages, or CLI improvements? Share your suggestions by opening an issue.
*   **Provide Feedback:** General feedback on the tool's usability, documentation clarity, or overall concept is always welcome via GitHub Issues.

Your feedback and bug reports during this phase will be invaluable as we refine SpiceCode and prepare it for wider community involvement.

Thank you again for your interest in SpiceCode. We look forward to the time when we can welcome your contributions more directly!
